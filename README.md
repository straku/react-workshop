# React workshop app

Simple webpack boilerplate and "shop" application based on it.

## Features

- ES6
- SASS
- CSS Modules
- Integrated server with automatic refresh (`webpack-dev-server`)

## Running

To run, first clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/straku/react-workshop.git
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
And executre `npm` script
```
npm start
```
It will launch server on port `4500`, if you want to change port use `--port` option in `npm` script definition located in `package.json` file.

Server will reload on every code or style change (nothing fancy, just page refresh without preserving components state).
